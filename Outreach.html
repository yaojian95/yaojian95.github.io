<u1>
<li> Molecules in the atmosphere scatter more blue light than red. Scattered light intensity is proportional to the fourth power of frequency.</li>
<li>At Horizon, we can only see the light without scattered, that is red.</li>
<li>When the Sun is above us, we see the more scattered blue light.</li>
<li>Our eyes are somewhat more sensitive to blue light than to violet light, so the sky appears blue.</li>
