<h2>Primordial Non-gaussianity</h2>
The general perturbed metric is given by

    \begin{equation}
        d s^{2}=-(1+2 \Psi) d t^{2}+a^{2}(t)\left[(1-2 \Phi) \gamma_{i j}+2 h_{i j}\right] d x^{i} d x^{j}
    \end{equation}

Current observations support a range of inflation models, according to which the probability distribution of primordial fluctuations are very close to Gaussian. 
Different classes of models have their own characteristic non-Gaussian deviation.
They provide us with a method, which will help in isolating the inflation model that accurately describes our Universe.
<br>
We construct non-Gaussian primordial gravitational potential $\Phi$, which is defined above, as a function of
conformal distance by adding a non-linear term as

\begin{equation}
\Phi(r)=\Phi_{\mathrm{L}}(r)+f_{\mathrm{NL}} \Phi_{\mathrm{NL}}(r)
\end{equation}

where $\Phi_{\mathrm{NL}}$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\mathrm{NL}}(r)=\left(\Phi_{\mathrm{L}}(r)\right)^{2}-\left\langle\left(\Phi_{\mathrm{L}}(r)\right)^{2}\right\rangle
\end{equation}

and $f_{NL}$ is a measure of the extent of non-Gaussianity in the field. The quantity
$\Phi$, sets the initial conditions for the theoretical calculation of CMB temperature
and polarization fluctuations. Hence the information about primordial nonGaussianity will be encoded in the CMB fluctuations.
<br>
<br>
The search for primordial non-Gaussianity requires statistical observables,
which are capable of detecting the presence of any non-Gaussian features in the
CMB fields. A few examples of this kind of statistical observables in Fourier space are power
spectrum, bispectrum, and trispectrum. While the statistical observables such as Betti numbers, Minkowski functionals, Tensor Minkowski Functionals are
defined in real space.

<h2>Minkowski functionals</h2>

<h3>Topological concepts</h3>

<ol>
    <li>excursion set</li>
    <li>simply connected and multiply connected</li>
    <li>  genus </li>
  </ol>

Table 1. Minkowski functionals $M_{\nu}$ can be related to simple geometric quantities in two and three dimensions.
\begin{array}{llll}
\hline & $\nu$ & Geometric quantity & Minkowski functional $M_{\nu}$ \\
\hline$d=2:$ & 0 & covered area $F$ & $M_{0}(K)=F(K)$ \\
& 1 & boundary length $U$ & $M_{1}(K)=(1 / 2 \pi) U(K)$ \\
& 2 & Euler characteristic $\chi$ & $M_{2}(K)=(1 / \pi) \chi(K)$ \\
\hline$d=3:$ & 0 & volume $V$ & $M_{0}(K)=V(K)$ \\
& 1 & surface $S$ & $M_{1}(K)=\frac{1}{8} S(K)$ \\
& 2 & mean curvature $H$ & $M_{2}(K)=\left(1 / 2 \pi^{2}\right) H(K)$ \\
& 3 & Euler characteristic $\chi$ & $M_{3}(K)=(3 / 4 \pi) \chi(K)$ \\
\hline
\end{array}


In two dimensions, the Minkowski functionals are the covered area of the excursion set, the boundary length between
the homogeneous domains and the Euler characteristic, i.e. the number difference of
connected domains and holes.
<br>
<br>
The Minkowski functionals of Gaussian fields are known analytically as functions of the threshold.
