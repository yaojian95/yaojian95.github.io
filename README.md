What do you mean by **Solenoidal** vector?
In vector calculus a solenoidal vector field (also known as an incompressible vector field, a **divergence-free** vector field, or a **transverse** vector field) is a vector field v with divergence zero at all points in the field: A common way of expressing this property is to say that the field has no sources or sinks.
