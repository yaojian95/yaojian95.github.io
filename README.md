## Welcome to my personal page.

The trace of the metric is always just <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\delta_\mu^{\mu}%20=%20d">, the number of spacetime dimensions.

The stress-energy tensor is defined as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T^{\mu%20\nu}%20\equiv%20\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}}%20\frac{\delta%20S_{\mathrm{pp}}}{\delta%20g_{\mu%20\nu}}">

- What do you mean by **Solenoidal** vector?
In vector calculus a solenoidal vector field (also known as an incompressible vector field, a **divergence-free** vector field, or a **transverse** vector field) is a vector field v with divergence zero at all points in the field: A common way of expressing this property is to say that the field has no sources or sinks.
